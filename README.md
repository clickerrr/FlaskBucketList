This bucket list app is meant to demonstrate the ability to do simple user login and verification alongside a place for maintaining a list of things to do. It features basic functionality such as adding and removing items from a to do list specific to one user.

This project was made as an exploratory project outside of class time to practice python and use of the Python-Flask webapp framework based off Django. Additionally it was pratice for reading documentation for Flask and various other Flask related packages such as Flask Login and WTForms. This was done through minimizing the use of Stackoverflow, YouTube tutorials, or any other tutorials on Flask and other packages to familiarize myself with them and see how strongly I can learn a new framework with little help. The use of various tutorial sites were utilized, but done so sparingly to learn how to read documentation. This project also allowed me to focus on CSS and Javascript skills on top of the backend work, as well as introducing me to the idea of real time updates using AJAX.
